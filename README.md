# To-Fix
 ⚠ Fix file reading logic: Ensure names are correctly paired (i.e., read FName LName from one line instead of separate loops).
 
 ⚠ Initialize savedHighest before use to prevent undefined behavior.
 
 ⚠ Use else if in letterGrade() to improve efficiency.

 ⚠ Improve documentation for function parameters and return values.
 
 ⚠ Consider dynamically allocating studentRecords with new to avoid fixed-size arrays.
